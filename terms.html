                your specific Subscription’s current billing cycle, then that Subscription Fee will not be refunded to you.

                billing cycle. All sales are final and there are no refunds issued.</p>

                by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the
                remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of
                any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any
                other term, and SoundSnap's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not
                constitute a waiver of such right or provision. SoundSnap reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service
                at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes.</p>
            <p class="dodo">Your use of the SoundSnap website following any update, amendment, and/or change to these Terms of Service will

                invalidity thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the CAMC Arbitration Rules. The appointing
