                reserved by Licensor. Please note the following license restrictions regarding our content. You may not:</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li class="dodo">Resell, rent, sublicense, transmit, and/or distribute or re-distribute the sounds 'as they are' in any context,
                    this includes but is not exclusive to re-selling the sounds on CDs, torrents, or any other online distribution.</li>
                <li class="dodo"> Use any sound, music loop, or one-shots to create expansion packs to distribute them through any mobile applications,

                    on any CD(s), websites, and/or digital platforms of any kind (either for a fee or for free).</li>
                <li class="dodo">Use any sound, music loop, or one-shots for any trademark uses. This includes attempting to or actually registering

                    form (as they are), due to licensing restrictions. For instance, you cannot use an unaltered music loop
                    as a soundtrack for a film or video game. Using them as part of a music track, musical score, or creative
                    composition within a film is permitted.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="spec">4. Restrictions</p>
            <p class="dodo">The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:</p>
            <p class="dodo">You may copy, use, alter or change, make derivative works from, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
                and/or distribute any Work only under the terms of this License. You may not offer or impose any terms on
                the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
                hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
                publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
                in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License.</p>
            <p class="dodo">In no circumstances whatsoever, may you copy all or a significant part of the Works in the SoundSnap website
                with the purpose of redistributing them.</p>
            <p class="dodo">You may not use music loops (sounds labeled in the “Soundsnap Beats licensed by Music Loops category) uploaded
                by ‘Loop Masters' in isolation and unmodified in any medium. All music loops must be used in the context
                of an original music composition.</p>
            <p class="spec">5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</p>
            <p class="dodo">Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties in writing, Licensor offers the Work as is and makes no representations
                or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, without
                limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or
                the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence of absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.</p>
            <p class="spec">6. Limitation on Liability</p>
            <p class="dodo">Except to the extent required by applicable Law, in no event will the Licensor be liable to you on any legal
                theory for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of this License
                or the use of the Work, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
            <p class="spec">7. Termination</p>
            <p class="dodo">This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms
                of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works from You under this License,
                however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance
                with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. Subject
                to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
                copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
                different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election
                will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
                under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
                as stated above.</p>
            <p class="spec">8. Miscellaneous</p>
            <p class="dodo">If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
                or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
                to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
                valid and enforceable.</p>
            <p class="dodo">No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
                consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</p>
            <p class="dodo">This License, which is part of and is governed by, the Terms of Service Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement
                between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations
                with respect to the Work not specified therein. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions
                that may appear in any communication from You. This License may only be modified by the mutual written agreement
                of the Licensor and You.</p>
